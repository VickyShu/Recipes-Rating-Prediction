<p><strong>Authors</strong>: Xin Shu, Chang Shu</p>

<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project aims to predict the ratings giving by people based on several features. This is a project for DSC80 at UCSD. The dataset used to investigate this topic can be find <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kIbMz6jlhleiZ9_3QthmUnifoSds_2EI/view">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="framing-the-problem">Framing the Problem</h2>
<p>In the culinary world, the balance between taste and health is a subject of much interest and debate. Meals are a critical factor in this balance, directly affecting an individual’s health and well-being. In this project, we aim to predict the rating of a recipe based on various features, like average rating of a recipe, number of ratings for each recipe, users’ average rating for recipes, and minutes to prepare a recipe. Therefore, we will build a regression model to fit our data to predict the rating for unseen recipes.</p>

<h3 id="response-variable"><strong>Response Variable</strong></h3>
<p>We chose <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rating</code> as the response variable, which has five different classes from star one to star five. Understanding the rating of a recipe helps people to regulate their meals for better health.</p>

<h3 id="evaluation-metrics"><strong>Evaluation Metrics</strong></h3>
<p>To evaluate the model’s performance, we will use metrics such as <strong>RMSE</strong>. That’s because there are lots of outliers in our features, like lots of time to prepare recipes. So we choose RMSE because it is sensitive to outliers. It will give a higher error value, signaling that these points are not being predicted accurately.</p>

<h2 id="baseline-model">Baseline Model</h2>

<h3 id="model-description">Model Description</h3>
<p>In our baseline model, we intend to predict whether the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rating</code> is based on the average rating of the recipe and total minutes needed to prepare for a recipe. We will use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">recipe_average_rating</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log_minute</code> as features of our baseline Linear Regression model.</p>

<h3 id="feature-transformations">Feature Transformations</h3>
<p>For this baseline model, we did not have any categorical features, so we did not need to use OneHotEncoder() or any other categorical transformations.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">recipe_average_rating</code>: This is a ordinal feature. We just keep it as the raw integer value for simplicity.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minutes</code>: This is a nominal feature. We decided to perform a transformation for it because we found that some recipes need a huge amount of time to prepare. Thus, we have to transform minutes by log to make it more suitable for prediction.</p>

<iframe src="assets/fig_log_min.html" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>Our model achieved a training RMSE of 0.3715 and a testing RMSE of 0.5147. This level of accuracy indicates that the model has a reasonably good predictive capability. That is, if a recipe has a high average rating, it is more likely to receive similarly high ratings from new reviewers, keeping its high score. Our model’s performance corroborates this theory, following the tendency of recipes with higher ratings to maintain higher future ratings.</p>

<h2 id="final-model">Final Model</h2>
<p>After several trials, we decided to use DecisionTreeRegressor as our model. The reason is that Decision Trees can capture nonlinear relationships between features and the response variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rating</code>. This is beneficial because the preparation time, average rating, and the final rating of a recipe is not linear based on the plots we draw. Here are the features we chose:</p>

<iframe src="assets/fig_average_user_rating.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe> -->

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">recipe_average_rating</code>: For the average rating of a recipe, we want to examine if a recipe with higher rating would receive a higher rating from people.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">recipe_num_ratings</code>: For the number of ratings for each recipe, we want to study whether a recipe with a higher number of ratings possibly tends to receive higher ratings from people.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user_average_rating</code>: For the user’s average rating, we want to check if a person tends to give a higher rating just because he habitually gives high scores.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minutes</code>: For the minutes, we want to see if a higher rating recipe needs more time to prepare generally.</p>
